Language used - Python
Test Framework used - pytest


Automated Test Approach:
************************

The test framework is designed to automatically read all relevant report files from the "files" directory, specifically targeting files with names that begin with the pattern y_*.

Each of these input report files will be used to run a test that checks for duplicate columns.

The tests are parameterized based on the input file names. This means that for every report file detected, a separate instance of the test will be executed.

For example, if there are 5 report files matching the pattern, the test case will run 5 times—once per file—and the test results will show five distinct parameterized test executions.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Test 1

Test Scenario 1 - No column can be reported twice.

Test name in code : "test_for_duplicate_columns"

Logic: 
For each input file, data from each column will be read and compared against all other columns within the same file to identify any duplicates.

Execution Results : Pass ( for all the relevant input files provided)

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Test 2

Test Scenario 2 - Validate [Yes/No] Type.

Test name in code : test_file_column_data_types

Logic :

For each input report file, the test will reference the corresponding Data Definition File to identify any columns defined with the type "[Yes/No]". If such columns are present, the test will verify that the corresponding columns in the report file conform to the expected [Yes/No] data format.

Note : 

This test is designed to validate the data types of ALL columns in the report file based on the associated data definition. 
The framework is designed to automatically handle any updates to the data definition or report file.

Currently, the test is set up to validate only columns with the data type [Yes/No].
To validate additional columns, please provide the specific column name(s) as input to the test.
For detailed instructions, refer to the code documentation.

Execution Results :
Failed = 1, File name : "y_07.01.csv", Column - c0080, does not confirm the [Yes/No] type.
